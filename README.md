# [Incogni.me](https://mdawsondev.github.io/incogni.me/src/index.html) [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/5c97894c-08e6-4d53-9945-da77f49dde4f)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-mdawsondev-alias-generator-master)

### About
------
Incogni.me is a word generator focused on the creation of unique usernames. Using a series of controlled properties, users can generate content from predefined words, or via custom input.

This project is open source, and can be used [right here on GitHub](https://mdawsondev.github.io/incogni.me/src/index.html)!

### History
------
Incogni.me is the successor to "Alias Generator," one of the first applications I created. Originally, Alias Generator was a challenge to see how much I knew about web development before diving into several major online courses. After learning a significant number of new concepts, I decided to revisit and reproduce the entire project from the ground up. The entire engine has been rebuilt and redesigned.
